                <h2>What is an organ transplant?</h2>
                <p>An organ transplant is when a donor gives their healthy organ to somebody who has an organ beyond healing. Surgeons will remove the organ from the healthy donor and transplant it into the person. Some examples of organs that are commonly transplanted include the liver, kidney, heart, lungs, and more.</p>

            <div class="info-block">
                <h2>The Process of Organ Transplantation</h2>
                <p>The first step in ensuring an organ transplant goes to plan is making sure that the person receiving the organ has an eligible donor. All this means is ensuring the person donating their organ matches a certain criteria. Usually, the doctor has to evaluate the donor and recipient on a case-by-case basis. Commonly, these are some of the things they look for when transplanting: healthy organ, organ size, blood type, and type of organ to prevent the recipient's body from rejecting the new organ. Next, they prioritize the patient's condition, and based on their condition, they will receive the organ first. The final part is the actual transplant, where the donor's organ is placed into the patient.</p>

            <div class="info-block">
                <h2>How Does it Work?</h2>
                <p>Overall, this technology works by removing a damaged organ from a patient's body and removing the organ from the recipient while keeping it alive and transplanting it into the recipient to keep that part working and save a life.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="info-block">
                <h2>What Is to be expected?</h2>
                <p>Once an organ has been transplanted into a patient, many things may occur. If the organ is transplanted successfully without any complications, then a patient can expect different things based on the organ transplanted, but hereâ€™s a general overview. First, patients can often be placed in an intensive care unit to ensure that the newly transplanted organ is working as well as seeing if the body accepted this organ. This process can last weeks, so doctors will prescribe pain medications to lessen the patient's pain. Once it is all clear, a doctor will let you go home, but you should take safety precautions. These precautions include medications or food not to take and regular appointments. These appointments are often to check blood pressure, oxygen levels, and overall how the patient feels. Finally, when they reassured you the organ is stable, you can slowly start visiting the doctors less often, but still once in a while, just to be safe.</p>

            <div class="info-block">
                <h2>More on Why.</h2>
                <p>An organ transplant involves removing an organ from a person's body and putting it into someone who is ill or dying. It can save the life of the person who receives the organ. In 2022, over 40000 organs were donated in the USA alone, which means around 41000 people were able to have a second chance at life or increase their lifespan (Cindyyoung, 2023b). The donor has two parts of the organ or is dead, in which they have consented to use their organs for the purpose of transplantation. This is why it is being used to this day. </p>
